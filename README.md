# SmartForms

Smart Forms advance current forms technology with embedded business logic and a better UX.   
Large organizations have adapted them such as Royal Bank of Canada and HSBC in areas such as 
complex/multi-department product enrollment and servicing, ‘Know Your Customer’ processes, 
and other simple tasks such as customer referrals and audit check lists.

Smart Forms are locally run web ‘apps’.    They can run inside of a host app, like how pdf Reader behaves today.    
This provides cross platform support in limited network conditions.    They can also be run from the internet in a browser.
